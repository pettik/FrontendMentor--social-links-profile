# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

![Design preview for the Social links profile coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

My challenge was to build out this **social links profile** and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I ensured that my users could:  

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was a great opportunity for me to practice basic HTML and CSS tags. I recently updated my HTML and CSS files to apply CSS methodology (BEM).
